#  About the Paper and it's Authors

##  Tamar R Makin

- Tamar R Makin is a neuroscientist
- She is currently a professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Cambridge

## Andjean-Jacques Orban Dexivry

- Andjean-Jacques Orban Dexivry is an assistant professor at KU Leuven (a university in Belgium)

## The Inspiration for the Paper

- Since both of the authors are neuroscientists, the paper was primarily inspired by mistakes made in neuroscience papers/journals
- These mistakes are due to flawed experimental design, inappropriate analyses, or improper interpretation of results

# Ten Most Common Statistical Mistakes 

## Absence of an adequate control condition/group

- Define the Problem: A control group might be present but there is some confounding variable present that impacts the variable being studied.
- " It is also important that the control and experimental groups are sampled at the same time and with randomised allocation, to minimise any biases."
- The control and experimental group should be identical (or at least close to identical) in every way except the variable of interest
- Why is it a problem: In order to make a claim about the effectiveness of some treatment/intervention/variable, there needs to be an adequate base line to compare it to
- How to Spot it: Either there is no control group that is being compared to, or there is a control group but key features are not accounted for
- How to fix it: "If the experimental design does not allow for separating the effect of time from the effect of the intervention, then conclusions regarding the
 impact of the intervention should be presented as tentative"
