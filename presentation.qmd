#  About the Paper and it's Authors

##  Tamar R Makin

- Tamar R Makin is a neuroscientist
- She is currently a professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Cambridge

## Andjean-Jacques Orban Dexivry

- Andjean-Jacques Orban Dexivry is an assistant professor at KU Leuven (a university in Belgium)

## The Inspiration for the Paper

- Since both of the authors are neuroscientists, the paper was primarily inspired by mistakes made in neuroscience papers/journals
- These mistakes are due to flawed experimental design, inappropriate analyses, or improper interpretation of results
